# Gesture Control with OpenCV Python
Gesture Control Based Computer Command Implementation

This project is the "Gesture Control" application, which is a sub-discipline of Image Processing. By using the OpenCV library in Python, it is possible to manually control the computer sound. For example, when you listen to music, it is possible to adjust the volume of the music with hand commands without pressing any keys. A great project that can be adjusted to the desired command with its sensitive hand position and fast response time!
